### 📜 Problem Description

Geek wants to send a secret message to his friend Keeg. Instead of sending the original message directly, he encrypts it by inserting the character '*'.

Keeg decodes the message as follows:

- Traverse the encoded string from left to right and initialize the original string as empty.

- Whenever a normal character appears, append it to the current original string.

- Whenever '*' is encountered, remove it and append all characters before it to the end of the current original string.

- Repeat until no '*' remains.

Given the original string s, find the lexicographically smallest encrypted string that decodes to s.

**Examples :**

```
Input: s = "ababcababcd"
Output: ab*c*d
Explanation: We can encrypt the string in following way : "ababcababcd" -> "ababc*d" -> "ab*c*d"

```

```
Input: s = "zzzzzzz"
Output: z*z*z
Explanation: The string can be encrypted in 2 ways: "z*z*z" and "z**zzz". Out of the two "z*z*z" is smaller in length.
```

**Constraints:** 
1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105
